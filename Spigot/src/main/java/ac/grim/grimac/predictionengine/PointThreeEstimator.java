/**
 * A lot of care was put into handling all the stupid stuff occurring between events
 * <p>
 * Such as: Placing water and lava in a worldguard region to climb up walls within 0.03
 * A single tick of bubble columns
 * Placing ladders in worldguard regions
 * Some plugin thinking it's funny to spam levitation effects rapidly
 * Some plugin thinking it's funny to spam gravity effects rapidly
 * Someone trying to false grim by using negative levitation effects
 * Open trapdoor, 0.03 upward into closed trapdoor, open trapdoor the tick before the next movement.
 * <p>
 * We must separate horizontal and vertical movement
 * The player can never actually control vertical movement directly
 * Vertically - we must compensate for gravity and for stepping movement
 * <p>
 * Stepping can be compensated for by expanding by 0.03, seting the vector down by the minimum movement allowed
 * and then moving the box up by the collision epsilon, and then pushing the box by 0.03 again
 * avoiding using the isEmpty() and rather using the collision move method, to avoid bypass/abuse
 * <p>
 * Jumping movement IS one of these starting vectors, although the length between the jump and
 * not jumping is outside the allowed vectors - as jumping cannot desync
 * <p>
 * Fluid pushing is quite strange - we simply expand by 0.03 and check for horizontal and vertical flowing.
 * As poses often desync, we cannot actually know the exact value.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, we must recheck for fluid between world updates to see if the player was swimming
 * or in lava at any point within the skipped tick
 * <p>
 * We must also check for a player starting gliding, stopping gliding, all within 0.03, which might
 * be possible due to mojang's implementation of gliding and netcode
 * <p>
 * We must also check for the user placing ladders, which gives them control of vertical movement
 * once again also between world changes
 * <p>
 * We must also be aware of sneaking, which is implemented terribly by mojang
 * There should be a post check for sending sneaking updates, but it's not implemented yet...
 * If the user has been sneaking for 2 movements without stopping, then we know that they are sneaking
 * This is due to poses being done AFTER the player moves, adding a 50 ms delay
 * And due to slowness processing BEFORE poses are updated, adding another 50 ms delay
 * However, on 1.13, the delay is instant because mojang wasn't given a chance to be incompetent -_-
 * <p>
 * We also must be aware of levitation from the last tick
 * We also must be aware of bubble columns
 * <p>
 * Additionally, because poses are done AFTER the previous tick, we must know the minimum height the player's
 * bounding box can be, to avoid noclip falses.  Funnily enough, vanilla falses due to this...
 * This is done because when the player can't have changed their pose for one tick, the second we know their god
 * damn pose.  The third tick fixes the slow movement desync.  Thanks a lot, mojang - for falsing
 * your own anticheat and not caring enough to fix it.  Causing this giant mess that we all know you won't
 * fix for another decade... and if you do fix it... you will only make it worse (remember the bucket desync?)
 * <p>
 * Call me out for the code (in this class) - but please put the blame on Mojang instead.  None of this would be needed
 * if Minecraft's netcode wasn't so terrible.
 * <p>
 * 1.18.2 fixes this issue.  However, this code must now be applied to tick skipping,
 * and I don't feel like writing another rant about tick skipping as mojang will never fix it, as it would
 * increase bandwidth usage.  At least it only causes falses occasionally, and not bypasses.
